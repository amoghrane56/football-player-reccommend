Football Player Recommender
Project Overview
This project analyzes football player and team statistics to identify key performance metrics that influence team success. By correlating these metrics with league rankings, it highlights squad weaknesses and recommends top players to address these areas, aiding in strategic recruitment and tactical adjustments.

Data Sources
Player Statistics (player_df): Detailed metrics on individual player performances throughout a football season.
Team Statistics (team_df): Metrics on team achievements and league rankings.
Key Concepts
League Rank (LgRk):

Represents the league rank of each team. Lower values indicate better performance.
Player Performance Metrics:

Includes goals, assists, pass completion, and other statistics that quantify player contributions to team success.
Correlation Analysis:

Identifies features that correlate positively or negatively with a team's league rank, helping to pinpoint performance factors.
Identifying Squad Weaknesses:
